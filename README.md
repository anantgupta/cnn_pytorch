# Cnn_pytorch

# Abstract
This code is a new neural network for image recognition, mainly made for learning purposes.
The implemented code has a combination of 6 convolutional layers, 6 classifiers for element-wise max operation (ReLu layers) and 2 subregions-wise max operation (maxPool2d layers).

# Technologies
Pytorch was used with TINY IMAGENET dataset for all training, testing and validation purposes for the scope of this project.
The environment was created in linux alongwith shell scripts for testing purposes. I used Nvidea 1080Ti to implement the final project.
